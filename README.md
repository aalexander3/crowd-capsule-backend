# Crowd Capsule
A globally crowd-sourced digital time capsule designed for interstellar communications

## Motivation
In 1977 NASA sent into space gold-plated records containing sounds and image portraying life on earth
Today, Crowd Capsule is remixing the Golden Record with:
 * A globally crowd-sourced digital time capsule designed for interstellar communications
 * Crowd Capsule not only connects us to spacefaring beings it also connects us as earthlings

Weâ€™ve designed a system in which the citizens of earth from every culture can decide democratically how we will tell and show our story to the universe

Crowd Capsule was conceived and built in 36 hours by developers [Helen Liutongco][helen], [Eric Kim][eric], [Arren Alexander][arren], [Matt Garret][matt], [Frank McManus][frank], and [Kate Schlunz][kate] as a solution for NASA's 2018 Space Apps Challenge - [Remix the Golden Record][remix]

## Features
